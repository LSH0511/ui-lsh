            <p>
                The professional barriers in the UI design industry are constantly rising. Single
                aesthetic skills are no longer sufficient to meet market demands. Therefore,
                identifying key areas for development and formulating corresponding learning and
                evolution strategies is crucial for any practitioner hoping to achieve long-term
                success in this field.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have divided the areas for development into four interrelated dimensions and
                outlined specific learning outcomes that need to be focused on in the workplace

                <div class="promote-sub">
                    <p>First, enhance design thinking skills, enabling the production of well-reasoned
                    design solutions that go beyond mere aesthetics, based on user research and
                    business objectives. Clearly articulate the underlying logic during design reviews.
                    Understand and apply design system construction and maintenance methods in
                    practice, rather than creating isolated page designs.</p>

                    <p>
                        Second, improve key interpersonal and collaborative skills, effectively
                        communicating design value and decision-making rationale in language beyond the
                        understanding of non-designers. Proactively communicate with the development
                        team, understand technical constraints, collaboratively find the optimal solution for
                        design implementation, and build trust.

                    <p>
                        Third, deeply learn core design software, mastering its use to create visually highly
                        professional and aesthetically pleasing designs with meticulous attention to pixel-
                        level detail. Create prototypes with subtle animations to demonstrate interactive
                        states and enhance design expressiveness.

                    <p>
                        Fourth, continuously stay informed about cutting-edge fields such as immersive
                        experiences, voice interaction, inclusive design, and sustainable design. Effectively
                        utilize AI tools to improve personal work efficiency and creative breadth

                <h2>Self-Promotion</h2>
                <p>Today, a UI designer's professional competence is reflected not only in design
                    execution but also in the building and dissemination of their personal brand.
                    Excellent self-promotion can transform a designer from a passive job seeker into
                    an active communicator of value, thus gaining an advantage in fierce market
                    competition.</p>

                    <div class="promotion-text">
                        <p>Firstly, regarding personal promotion, establish a personal domain or website
                            dedicated to showcasing your UI design portfolio. Keep early sketches of each
                            project. Then, regularly update the portfolio, deleting or replacing unsatisfactory
                            parts.</p>

                    <div class="promotion-text">
                        <p>Alternatively, leverage social media and design communities. A personal website
                            alone often fails to gain widespread attention; utilizing social platforms and design
                            communities is crucial for increasing visibility. Participate in design communities
                            and WeChat groups, such as initiating discussion threads about your UI work and
                            inviting feedback. The interaction itself can also promote your work.</p>

                        <p>Then, if possible, build your own personal brand—though this is currently
                            challenging for me. This involves documenting your design experience, processes,
                            and thoughts through blog posts, videos, or social media posts. In design
                            communities, this not only showcases mature works but also allows you to share
                            your "process," "failures," and "reflections."</p>
                    </div>

                <div class="promotion-item">
                    <div class="promotion-text">
                        <p>Next, I proactively reached out to potential clients and the design community. I
                            planned to explicitly state in groups that I was seeking UI/interface design
                            collaborations, including links to my portfolio, to increase my chances.</p>
                    </div>

                        <div class="promotion-ball">

            <div class="promotion-title">
                <p>Finally, I believe promotion is a long-term process, and the key lies in "continuous
                    optimization" and "feedback utilization." Continuous optimization will improve the
                    quality of my work; I will receive feedback, make improvements, summarize the
                    findings, and republish or update the improved content.</p>
